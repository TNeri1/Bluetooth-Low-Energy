# Bluetooth-Low-Energy

# Overview

As a software engineer I want to further my learning by learning Bluetooth. Specifically I will be focusing on Bluetooth Low Energy.

For this repository I will be attempting to experiment around with bluetooth and keep this repository as a place for anyone to refer to who is getting started in Bluetooth Development.

After trudging through numerous sources finding tutorials and correct sources to get started in bluetooth may be a bit confusing. I hope that through this README I can provide my personal journey of sorts and links to websites or sources that will be essential or useful to anyone starting.
